  - Implemented occlusion-based heatmaps and saliency maps for model interpretability.
  - Developed a Flask web application for emotion detection via webcam and uploaded images.

## RNAseq Data Analysis (10/2023 – 04/2024)

- **Description:** Analyzed RNAseq data from pancreatic cancer patients to find genetic markers linked to immune response.
- **Achievements:**
  - Employed feature selection with Random Forest and regression models.
  - Developed visualizations using Matplotlib and Seaborn to illustrate gene expression patterns.

## GPS Data Analysis for Taxi Activity (05/2022 – 08/2022)

- **Description:** Extracted and visualized GPS data to illustrate taxi activity in Bangkok.
- **Achievements:**
  - Created heatmaps to offer a detailed view of high-traffic billboard zones.
